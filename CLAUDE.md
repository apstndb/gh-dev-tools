# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

**IMPORTANT**: This file must be written entirely in English. Do not use Japanese or any other languages in CLAUDE.md.

## Project Overview

gh-dev-tools provides generic GitHub development tools optimized for AI assistants. This is a standalone repository extracted from spanner-mycli dev-tools to create reusable GitHub operations tools.

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

**Before ANY push to the repository**:
1. **Always run `make check`** - runs test && lint (required for quality assurance)
2. **Resolve conflicts with origin/main** - ensure branch can merge cleanly to avoid integration issues
3. **Never push directly to main branch** - always use Pull Requests
4. **Never commit directly to main branch** - always use feature branches

## Essential Commands

```bash
# Development cycle (CRITICAL)
make check          # REQUIRED before ANY push (runs test && lint)
make build          # Build gh-helper tool
make test-quick     # Quick tests during development

# Tool usage
./gh-helper --help  # Show available commands
./gh-helper reviews analyze <PR>  # Complete review analysis
./gh-helper reviews fetch <PR>    # Fetch review data
./gh-helper threads reply <ID>    # Reply to review thread
```

## Core Architecture

### gh-helper
- **Main package**: All functionality merged into single main package
- **Unified output**: JSON/YAML using goccy/go-yaml library
- **GitHub GraphQL**: Direct use of GitHub API types without conversion
- **AI-optimized**: Structured output for assistant workflows

## Development Workflow

### Branch Management
- **Feature branches**: Always create feature branches for development
- **Pull Requests**: All changes must go through PR review
- **No direct commits**: Never commit directly to main branch

### Testing and Quality
```bash
make test           # Full test suite (required before push)
make lint           # Code quality checks (required before push)
make check          # Combined test && lint (required before push)
```

### Git Practices
- Always use `git add <specific-files>` (never `git add .`)
- Link PRs to issues when applicable
- Check `git status` before committing

## Installation and Usage

### Development
```bash
git clone https://github.com/apstndb/gh-dev-tools.git
cd gh-dev-tools
make build
```

### Production
```bash
go install github.com/apstndb/gh-dev-tools/gh-helper@latest
```

## Key Features

- **Unified Review Analysis**: Comprehensive feedback analysis preventing missed critical issues
- **Structured Output**: YAML/JSON output optimized for AI assistant consumption
- **Batch Operations**: Minimize GitHub API calls through unified GraphQL queries
- **Thread Management**: Complete review thread lifecycle management

## Important Notes

- **GitHub API**: Uses GitHub GraphQL API directly for optimal performance
- **Output Formats**: Supports both YAML (default) and JSON output
- **AI-First Design**: Interface optimized for AI assistant workflows
- **No Dependencies**: Standalone tool with minimal external dependencies
